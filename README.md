# MPSTNï¼šLeveraging Intra-Period and Inter-Period Features for Enhanced Urban Rail Passenger Flow Prediction
Code for paper 'Leveraging Intra-Period and Inter-Period Features for Enhanced Urban Rail Passenger Flow Prediction'.<br /> Arxiv link for the paper will be give soon.<br />
Main insight for the paper is folding 1-d time-serise data as matrix according to the period. Then using CNN to dig the intra and inter period information and using GNN to intergrate spatial information
